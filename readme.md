## React / Typescript / Webpack Minimal Boilerplate
This boilerplate is meant to be the smallest possible boilerplate for using react with typescript and webpack.

It uses live-server for auto reloading, and only includes the core react libs. If you want to use redux and stuff like that add them or whatever.

If you want to have your app be universal, great! It's actually like, pretty easy to do. Maybe I'll make a version of this that does it, but it's sort of against the mentality of this one.

## License
Nobody likes when a boilerplate has a license file they need to keep around. This project uses the [Whatever The Fuck You Want Public License](http://wtfpl.com). Just like, do whatever. I don't care. Delete it if you want, or not.
